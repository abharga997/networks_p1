# networks_p1
This is the SmartHome assignment for my Network Client-Server class. 

I am on pt. 2 of 3 of the project. Right now I have to implement a message protocol with the classes in the SmartHome. I will upload the powerpoints to this that have the directions.

Per Eshan, what is needed to be done:
"Ok so you log in at each iteration of the loop. U said the request/response can be hard coded, so just print request and call the necessary function. First a request is sent for starting the data model.
The response is a username prompt, then once you type that in send another request in the code for the password. The response is a password prompt. Then another request is sent there for the meny.
Make a hash table or some data structure to store the statuses, use a list to store the function calls the devices."
